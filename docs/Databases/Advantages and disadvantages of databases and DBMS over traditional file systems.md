# Advantages and disadvantages of databases and DBMS over traditional file systems
## Databases
### **Advantages**
-   **ReducedÂ data redundancy.**
-   Also, there are **reduced errors and increased consistency.**
-   **Easier data integrity from application programs.
-   Improved **data access to users through the use of host and query languages.**
-   Data security is also improved.
-   Reduced data entry, storage, and retrieval costs.

## DBMS
### Advantages
1. **Minimized redundancy and data consistency**: 
	- Data is normalized in DBMS to **minimize the redundancy which helps in keeping data consistent** 
	- For Example, student information can be kept at one place in DBMS and accessed by different users
2. **Simplified Data Access**: 
	- A ***user need only name of the relation not exact location to access data***, so the process is very simple
3. **Multiple data views:** 
	- **Different views of same data can be created to cater the needs of different users.** 
	- For Example, faculty **salary information can be hidden from student view** of data but shown in admin view 
4. **Data Security:**
	- Only **authorized users are allowed to access the data** in DBMS
	- **Data can be encrypted by DBMS** which makes it secure
5. **Concurrent access to data**: 
	- Data **can be accessed concurrently by different users** at same time in DBMS
6. **Backup and Recovery mechanism:**
	- DBMS backup and recovery mechanism **helps to avoid data loss and data inconsistency in case of catastrophic failures**

### **Disadvantages**
1. **Complexity**:
	- **Implementing a database solution often involves understanding and applying complex topics** like normalization principles, designing relationships, and ensuring data integrity
2. **Cost**:
	- Many commercial database management systems (DBMS) **require purchasing expensive licenses**
	- Additional costs are also **associated with hiring skilled database administrators, (DBAs)developers and periodic software upgrades, support**
	- Databases also often **require high-performance servers and storage solutions to handle large volumes of data and transactions**, which can be costly
3. **Handling Performance Issues**:
	- **Databases can be resource-intensive**, requiring significant CPU, memory, and storage resources, especially as the volume of data grows
	- **Scaling databases to handle increased loads and larger datasets can be complex and expensive**, requiring distributed systems or cloud-based solutions
	- Databases **require regular maintenance tasks such as backups, indexing, and performance tuning,** which can be **time-consuming and require specialized knowledge**
4. **Data Integrity and Consistency**:
	- **Ensuring data integrity and consistency, especially in distributed databases or during concurrent transactions, requires sophisticated mechanisms** like [[ACID properties]] (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
	- **Managing and recovering from errors or failures** (e.g., hardware failures, software bugs) without data loss or corruption **can be complex**.
5. **Security**:
	- Upgrades and **maintenance activities can lead to downtime, affecting business operations and user access** to the database.
	- **Ensuring data privacy and compliance with regulations** like GDPR or HIPAA **requires continuous monitoring and updating of security practices**.
6. **Vendor Lock-In**:
	- Many databases use proprietary technology, which can lead to vendor lock-in. **Migrating data and applications to another system can be difficult and costly**.
	- **Integration with other systems and technologies can be problematic** if the database relies on proprietary formats or protocols.
7. **Data Redundancy and Duplication**:
	- **While normalization reduces redundancy, it can also lead to complex queries and performance overheads**. 
	- Conversely, **denormalization to improve performance can reintroduce redundancy and complicate data management**.
